<p class = "txt1">This website is the result of my Creative Writing portfolio project. The project instructions are as follows: "This is a final and counts as 10% of the course grade. Each entry for portfolio needs to be a minimum of 500 words. Only 1 poem is allowed to be included,and it needs to be a minimum of 15 lines. You need 10 entries. Half of the entries must come from the prompts we have done as bell work. The other half may come from the projects we did during the first 9 weeks. All entries may come from the prompts, The reflection piece needs to also be a minimum of 500 words. You may upload an electronic copy here or bring in a hard copy on final exam day."

<p class = "txt1 txt2">I didn't know what to expect from this class. I selected it because I enjoyed writing creatively in the past, and it's a great thing I did. Having an hour of essentially minimum creative boundries was a very enjoyable experience. Being able to come to this class before and after stressful assignments really made my school life a whole lot easier. Throughout my time here, I wrote some pieces that I'm very proud of, and some not so much. Despiteless, I put everything I could find on this website. Memories weren't made to forget, so this will serve as a constant reminder of everything that happened during my time here.</p>
